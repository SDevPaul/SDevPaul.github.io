                <p>The story follows a party of adventurers who vanquished the Demon King and restored harmony to the world after a ten-years-quest. 
                    The heroic group includes human hero Himmel, dwarven warrior Eisen, human priest Heiter, and elven mage Frieren. Before they part, 
                    they observe the Era Meteors together, a meteor shower that occurs once in fifty years. Frieren agrees to see them again and offer 
                    them a better view the next time the celestial event occurs. Frieren then departs and travels the world in pursuit of magical knowledge.
                    <br><br>
                    Fifty years later, Frieren returns to the capital, however, humanity has changed, and her former companions have distinctly aged. 
                    Himmel dies of old age after one last adventure to see the meteor shower. During the funeral, Frieren expressed guilt for not attempting 
                    to learn more about him. Frieren then paid a call to her former comrades. She accepts an offer to teach and care for Fern, an orphaned 
                    child adopted by Heiter. Another invitation she got was to travel to a soul's resting place and see Himmel again to bid the hero a fitting 
                    farewell and express her feelings. To fulfill those requests, Frieren embarks on a journey together with Fern while still pursuing her 
                    passion for learning magic.
