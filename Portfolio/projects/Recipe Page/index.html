					<h2>Fudgy Chocolate Brownie Cookies</h2>
					<hr />
					

					<!--P tag defines the paragraph-->
					<p>Fudgy Chocolate Brownie Cookies are very chocolaty, soft, chewy, highly fudgy, and gooey on the inside, with a crispy/crunchy exterior shell. 
					The wonderful thing about these cookies is that they just take one bowl of cupboard ingredients and a few simple steps, 
					making them the tastiest fudgy chocolate brownie cookies. There is no need to melt chocolate, prepare it, or use unusual ingredients.
