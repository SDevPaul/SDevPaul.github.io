                <p>The story follows a party of adventurers who vanquished the Demon King and restored harmony to the world after a ten-years-quest. 
                    The heroic group includes human hero Himmel, dwarven warrior Eisen, human priest Heiter, and elven mage Frieren. Before they part, 
                    they observe the Era Meteors together, a meteor shower that occurs once in fifty years. Frieren agrees to see them again and offer 
                    them a better view the next time the celestial event occurs. Frieren then departs and travels the world in pursuit of magical knowledge.
                    <br><br>
                    Fifty years later, Frieren returns to the capital, however, humanity has changed, and her former companions have distinctly aged. 
                    Himmel dies of old age after one last adventure to see the meteor shower. During the funeral, Frieren expressed guilt for not attempting 
                    to learn more about him. Frieren then paid a call to her former comrades. She accepts an offer to teach and care for Fern, an orphaned 
                    child adopted by Heiter. Another invitation she got was to travel to a soul's resting place and see Himmel again to bid the hero a fitting 
                    farewell and express her feelings. To fulfill those requests, Frieren embarks on a journey together with Fern while still pursuing her 
                    passion for learning magic.

                    <p>The fantasy genre was dying because of the repetitive themes and stereotypes that all of them used but.. Frieren was different. 
                        It's a story that teaches you to cherish your memories and have fun with the time you have. I love how they made the MC immortal 
                        so shes naturally used to caring about the time she has with others that made it possible for us to relate to her if we don't care 
                        about how time flies when we are with people dear to us. It's a very soft somehow calming anime in my opinion compared to everything 
                        ive watched up until now I would say this is something I can watch without stressing.
                    </p>

                    <p class="review-titles"><b>Touching, philosophical, profound, meaningful, sad and heartwarming anime.</b></p>
                    
                    <p>In the realm of animated tales, there exists a gem of profound emotion and contemplation. 
                        "Frieren" unfolds a poignant narrative, blending the hues of ignorance, regret, and the yearning to understand humanity. 
                        Frieren, once unaware of the depths of human nature, finds himself grappling with the haunting echo of missed opportunities 
                        and unspoken words after the passing of cherished friends.
                        <br><br>
                        As the scenes unfold, the story paints a portrait of profound regret etched on Frieren's soul. Regret for not delving into the 
                        essence of those dear to them, regret for the conversations left unsaid, the laughter that never echoed loud enough, and the 
                        understanding that eluded their grasp. This poignant realization dawns upon Frieren, a bittersweet melody that tugs at the 
                        heartstrings.
                        <br><br>
