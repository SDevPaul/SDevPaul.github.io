                    <p>The fantasy genre was dying because of the repetitive themes and stereotypes that all of them used but.. Frieren was different. 
                        It's a story that teaches you to cherish your memories and have fun with the time you have. I love how they made the MC immortal 
                        so shes naturally used to caring about the time she has with others that made it possible for us to relate to her if we don't care 
                        about how time flies when we are with people dear to us. It's a very soft somehow calming anime in my opinion compared to everything 
                        ive watched up until now I would say this is something I can watch without stressing.
                    </p>

                    <p class="review-titles"><b>Touching, philosophical, profound, meaningful, sad and heartwarming anime.</b></p>
                    
                    <p>In the realm of animated tales, there exists a gem of profound emotion and contemplation. 
                        "Frieren" unfolds a poignant narrative, blending the hues of ignorance, regret, and the yearning to understand humanity. 
                        Frieren, once unaware of the depths of human nature, finds himself grappling with the haunting echo of missed opportunities 
                        and unspoken words after the passing of cherished friends.
                        <br><br>
                        As the scenes unfold, the story paints a portrait of profound regret etched on Frieren's soul. Regret for not delving into the 
                        essence of those dear to them, regret for the conversations left unsaid, the laughter that never echoed loud enough, and the 
                        understanding that eluded their grasp. This poignant realization dawns upon Frieren, a bittersweet melody that tugs at the 
                        heartstrings.
                        <br><br>
                        In the wake of loss, Frieren sets forth on an odyssey, a journey to unravel the enigma of humanity. A pilgrimage driven by 
                        an insatiable desire to grasp the essence of human beings - to perceive their dreams, fears, hopes, and aspirations. 
                        Every step is a dance of sorrow and longing, a dance that is as captivating as it is heartbreaking.
                        <br><br>
                        The animation breathes life into this tale, the vivid colors and expressive strokes adding depth to the emotional tapestry. 
                        The elegiac soundtrack echoes the pain and joy of Frieren's quest, every note a whisper of the soul's lament.
                        <br><br>
                        Through Frieren's eyes, we witness the beauty of a newfound comprehension. Every interaction, every revelation, is a brushstroke 
                        painting a new layer of understanding on the canvas of his heart. The story, an exploration of the fragility of life and the 
                        potency of regrets, serves as a mirror to our own existence.
                        <br><br>
                        "Frieren" stands as a testament to the human condition, a somber reminder of the value of cherishing those around us, 
                        of the fleeting nature of time, and the importance of understanding and being understood. It unearths the eternal truth that 
                        sometimes, it takes loss to ignite a burning desire to truly know the beating hearts that surround us. And in this, lies the 
                        heartrending beauty of this unforgettable anime.
